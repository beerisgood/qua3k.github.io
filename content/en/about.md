I'm a pseudonymous security researcher mainly working on
[Hexavalent](https://github.com/Hexavalent-Browser/Hexavalent).

## Some Notes

I've taken an interest into memory safety, mainly because of grsecurity and the
PaX Team :) My work has gone from dealing with arbitrary code injection to
dealing with the current generation code reuse attacks and in the future, non
control-flow data only attacks.
