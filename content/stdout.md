Today I learned about standard streams. I now have a deeper understanding of computers than ever before.

For instance, I learned that `echo` writes to `stdout`, the standard output, by default.

```
{{<code "paste" "echo 'This prints to stdout'">}} 
```

You can even redirect it to `stderr`!

```
{{<code "paste" ">&2 echo 'This prints to stderr'">}} 
```

Anyways that's all I wanted to share.
