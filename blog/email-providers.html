<h1>Email Providers</h1>
<time>December 29, 2020</time>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I'm switching from Gmail because of their various privacy abuses, but the competition is confusing.
<p>Hours of searching and recommendations from various people, including multiple visits to <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytools.io</a> brings me two options: Tutanota and Protonmail.
<p>Both have their fair share of flaws, but Tutanota was recently forced to develop a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/german-secure-email-provider-tutanota-forced-to-monitor-an-account-after-regional-court-ruling/">backdoor</a> which they plan on appealing.
<p>I haven't found any major breaking flaws with Protonmail, but this article will be updated if that happens.

<h2>Encryption</h2>
<p>Protonmail encrypts all emails with PGP using their audited library OpenPGPjs. PGP is the golden standard for encrypting emails, and the choice to use PGP allows Protonmail users to email securely with anyone also using PGP.
<p>Tutanota uses their in-house encryption which is able to encrypt participants' names and subject lines, but is it worth using when you can only use it with other Tutanota users?
<p>They also say their encryption allows them to add perfect forward secrecy in the future.
<p>Maybe I'll take a look again in a couple of years.
