<h2>'Secure Email'</h2>
<p>There is <b>no such thing</b> as secure email. Email is an inherently insecure protocol, and no amount of marketing unicorn magic can make it secure. Secure email providers only make email less insecure.

<h2>The State of Email Security</h2>

<h3>Email Authentication</h3>

<h4>Domain Keys Identified Mail</h4>
<p>DKIM allows domain owners to sign email to prevent forging and modification. Receiving email servers can verify DKIM signed email to ensure the correspondence is authentic. However, DKIM signatures can be stripped from emails.

<h4>Sender Policy Framework</h4>
<p>SPF strictly controls the servers allowed to send email for a given domain, SPF does not check the 'from:' field of an email, but rather the return path, so a spoofed email can still pass SPF.

<h4>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance</h4>
<p>DKIM and SPF must be paired with DMARC to be effective. If a DMARC policy is defined, SPF and DKIM checking will be enforced for the domain.

<h3>Email Encryption</h3>
<h4>OpenPGP</h4>

<h5>Keyservers</h5>
<p>Keyservers present their own problems. They are set up so that any individual can upload a key for any email address, and they mitigate this by allowing individuals to sign each other's keys. <b>This does not work.</b> Anyone can sign your key, even if you have never communicated with them.

<h5>Metadata</h5>
<p>Metadata can be extremely revealing. Current email encryption <b>does not</b> provide any sort of metadata protection.

<h3>Mailbox Encryption</h3>
<p>Providers using 'zero-access encryption' can be legally compelled to disable encryption of new incoming emails.

<p>Avoid Email, but if you can't, use a reputable provider with a focus on security such as ProtonMail or Tutanota.
