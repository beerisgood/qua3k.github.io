About # Hexavalent is a security and privacy focused web browser based on the open source Chromium project. It seeks to develop meaningful security improvements with a defined threat model and is currently in development.
Changes # We&amp;rsquo;ve lifted patches from GrapheneOS&amp;rsquo;s Vanadium subproject and are currently in the process of developing and enabling security features that aren&amp;rsquo;t enabled upstream due to immaturity or performance overhead such as strict origin isolation, to address real exploits taking advantage of Chrome&amp;rsquo;s site isolation, and Ubercage, which is V8&amp;rsquo;s heap sandbox intended to prevent memory corruption outside the V8 heap.</description></item><item><title>Standard Streams</title><link>https://qua3k.github.io/stdout/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qua3k.github.io/stdout/</guid><description>Some cool stuff about standard streams.</description></item><item><title>Some Thoughts About the NSO Group's Pegasus</title><link>https://qua3k.github.io/pegasus/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qua3k.github.io/pegasus/</guid><description>My thoughts about the Pegasus spyware.</description></item><item><title>Hacking Whonix onto Hyper-V</title><link>https://qua3k.github.io/guides/whonix/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qua3k.github.io/guides/whonix/</guid><description>A guide to get Whonix running on Hyper-V.</description></item><item><title>Email (In)security</title><link>https://qua3k.github.io/security/email/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qua3k.github.io/security/email/</guid><description>There is no such thing as secure email. Email is an inherently insecure protocol, conceived at a time when security was an afterthought. There are fundamental flaws with email that cannot be mitigated by slapping encryption on top.</description></item><item><title>ungoogled-chromium</title><link>https://qua3k.github.io/ungoogled/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qua3k.github.io/ungoogled/</guid><description>As one of the most used applications in the system, it is ideal to have a secure browser. Browsers have large attack surface due to a combination of their complexity, handling of untrusted input, and use of unsafe languages. Even while browser makers continually work make their browsers more secure, most browsers have poor privacy out of the box. ungoogled-chromium is an often recommended browser because of its approach of stripping out Google web services from Chromium.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://qua3k.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qua3k.github.io/about/</guid><description>About me</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://qua3k.github.io/first/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qua3k.github.io/first/</guid><description>hi
